After I answer the questions, generate the required output files. Ensure `data_extractor.js`:

1) Uses robust HTML parsing with Cheerio only.
2) Enumerates schema classes from the chosen data group.
3) Attempts to extract instances for each class and map properties.
4) Leverages `getVerifiedScriptExamples` for mapping guidance when needed.
